This repository contains various C++ programming examples and implementations, focusing on fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## üéØ Semantic Versioning

This project uses **automated semantic versioning** based on commit messages:
- `feat:` ‚Üí Minor version bump (new features)
- `fix:` ‚Üí Patch version bump (bug fixes)  
- `BREAKING:` ‚Üí Major version bump (breaking changes)

See [Versioning Documentation](docs/VERSIONING.md) for complete details.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:
- ‚úÖ Automatic building and testing on every push
- ‚úÖ Automated test suite with comprehensive coverage
- ‚úÖ Binary artifact generation for every build
- ‚úÖ **Automated semantic versioning**
- ‚úÖ Manual release creation with custom versioning

### Creating Releases
To create a new release:
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in GitHub
2. Select "Manual Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose version bump type (auto/major/minor/patch)
5. Enter release notes
6. The system will build, test, version, and create the release automatically

See [CI/CD Documentation](.github/README.md) for more details.
